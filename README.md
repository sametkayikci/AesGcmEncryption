# AesGcmEncryption
This project provides a simple implementation of AES-GCM encryption and decryption using .NET 8. AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) offers both encryption and authentication, making it a secure choice for protecting sensitive data. This service uses AES-GCM **without padding** for precise control over the data size.
